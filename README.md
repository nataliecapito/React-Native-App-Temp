# General
## React-Native-App-Temp
- React Native - native application blank start template.

## Note:
- This will not run. There is no node_modules folder and there is not a package.json. This is simply to serve as a ref. to getting started with different things you can do in React-Native, ie, themes, routing, handling .svg icons, etc. If you are interested in this template AND want it to run, please checkout my other repo here: https://github.com/smacknat/React-Native-App-Sandbox.

## Particularly helpful docs. (for reference):
### There are two types of data that control a component:
- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/props.html -> passing in properties, aka parameters, in react.
- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/state.html -> how state works in react.

### API
- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/network.html
- https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-ajax.html

### Other:
- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/style.html -> styling; Note: essentially the same as HTML.
- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/flexbox.html -> styling with Flex is the bomb dot com, but works slightly different in react-native.
- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/using-a-scrollview.html -> scrollview's are the best and the worst.
- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/keyboard.html -> quick keyboard reference cus it is literally THE WORST.
