# General
## React-Native-App-Temp
- React Native - native application blank start template.

## Note:
- This file and application will NOT run.
- There is no node_modules folder and there is not a package.json.
- This repo. was designed to simply to serve as a template reference for quickly getting started on a FRESH React-Native project, ie, themes, routing, handling .svg icons, etc, are setup to be included in here marked with `// TODO:` indicators.
- If you are interested in this template PLUS want it to run, please checkout my other repo here: https://github.com/smacknat/React-Native-App-Sandbox, which contains all the files here, BUT in an already setup React-Native client.
